## Data

All data are contained in the directory `data/`. The original data containing the spatial coordinates of the animals are deposited on Movebank (ID: 5056848767). Due to conservation concerns, accessing to the original data on Movebank is restricted to the project team only. All data in the repository were pre-processed to spatial estimates used to fit subsequent models.
